# JavascriptGeneticAlgorithm

I decided to try making a genetic algorithm at the weekend, this one is pretty basic and is based on words and letters but could be expanded to do anything. The script is written in Javascript and should make a good base for making more complex versions. As with all Genetic Algorithm designing the test for fitness will still be the hardest part.
